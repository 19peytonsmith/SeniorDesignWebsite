                  Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.

            <h1>Abstract</h1>
            <p>Mouthpiece is a social media app used to share posts, pictures, and videos for a community of those interested in sports. This app connects athletes, sports fans, coaches/recruiters, trainers, and tournament organizers throughout the world. Athletes can gain a fan base by posting pictures, videos, and highlight reels which give exposure to coaches/recruiters. As for the recruiters, they can find out players' capabilities and assess their statistics. Trainers can find and help develop players by professionally training them. Teams can use this app for player scouting, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. The main purpose of the app is to highlight the skills shown by athletes, enabling the chance of scholarships or job opportunities.</p>
            <p>As for the construction of the project, our group is separated into both front and back-end developers. Front-end developers are responsible for how the app looks to the end-user. They design the user experience such as plotting what each button click does throughout the app. Back-end developers manage how the app operates under-the-hood. Using Google’s database, Firebase, they are responsible for storing data throughout the app such as user profile data, messages, posts, and tournament data. The app is for iOS devices starting out. Using an iOS exclusive IDE, Xcode, developers code the app using Apple’s programming language, Swift. </p>
            <p>Unlike other social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, this app is solely focused on sports-related content. This is made possible by an internal filter system in the app that monitors the type of content posted. Users are also able to sort the type of sports content they wish to see through embedded algorithms in the app. Overall, this app is a great choice for sports fans seeking convenient sports content without being overwhelmed by any other irrelevant content.</p>
